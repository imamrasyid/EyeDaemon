            The automated link checker has detected broken links in the documentation.

            **Workflow Run:** ${{ github.server_url }}/${{ github.repository }}/actions/runs/${{ github.run_id }}

            Please review the workflow logs and fix the broken links.

            ### Common Causes
            - External links that are no longer valid
            - Internal links with incorrect paths
            - Renamed or moved files
            - Typos in URLs

            ### How to Fix
            1. Check the workflow logs for specific broken links
            2. Update or remove the broken links
            3. Test locally before committing
            4. Re-run this workflow to verify fixes
